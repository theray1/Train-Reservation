= Small train reservation library


This project provides a small library that can be used to build a simple train reservation system.
It provides a way to create trains, cities, trips, and tickets.
The library makes sure that trips are consistent with each other (eg. no overlapping), and provides management facilities such as a way to delay a trip.

The library is written in Java and can be compiled using Maven.

== Compilation

To compile the project, run:

```
mvn package
```

== Usage


=== Configuring the system instance

Using this library requires creating a central and unique object of type `TicketReservationSystem`.
This can be obtained with an instance of the class `TicketReservationSystemImpl`.

Creating a `TicketReservationSystemImpl` requires choosing a time zone, which will be used by the system to parse all dates in methors called later on.

```java
// Choosing the time zone of the system, to parse times/dates
// Here we use the time zone of the system
ZoneId timeZone = ZoneId.systemDefault();

// Creating the system
TicketReservationSystem system = new TicketReservationSystemImpl(timeZone);
```


Once a system is created, it must be populated with basic information, such as cities and trains.

```java
// Creating and adding cities in the system
City rennesCity = new CityImpl("Rennes");
City nantesCity = new CityImpl("Nantes");
system.addCity(rennesCity);
system.addCity(nantesCity);

// Creating and adding a train in the system
Train smallTrain = new TrainImpl("petitTrain", 2);
system.addTrain(smallTrain);
```


=== Example: creating a trip

The main purpose of the library is to manage _trips_.
This requires specifying what is the start date and the arrival date of the trip, along with the starting and arrival cities, and the train used for the trip. 
Many constraints are verified when a trip is created â€” see the documentation for more information. 

```java  
Instant departure = TimeManagement.createInstant("2022-05-12 12:00", timeZone);
Instant arrival = TimeManagement.createInstant("2022-05-12 13:00", timeZone);
try {
    system.createTrip(rennesCity, nantesCity, smallTrain, departure, arrival);
} catch (TripException e) {
    // Do something if a constraint is unfulfilled
}
```
