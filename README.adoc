= Small train reservation library


This project provides a small library that can be used to build a simple train reservation system.
It provides a way to create trains, cities, trips, and tickets.
The library makes sure that trips are consistent with each other (eg. no overlapping), and provides management facilities such as a way to delay a trip.

The library is written in Java and can be compiled using Maven.
